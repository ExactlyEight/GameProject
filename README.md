## Why crimson grounds? 
<br>CRIMSON - a specific color of the blood 
<br>GROUNDS - as for the blood running on the grounds
<br><br>‚Ä¢	Blood will have a significant aspect in the game.

## Game: 
<br>Three main points about the game:
<br>‚Ä¢ Rough-like third view gameplay
<br>‚Ä¢	Beautiful graphics and environment
<br>‚Ä¢	Ability system 

## Gameplay idea:
<br>‚Ä¢	Going though the level, killing enemies, and progressing to the boss.
<br>‚Ä¢	If the player stays in the level stage for two long, number of enemies will increase.
<br>‚Ä¢	Through the gameplay improving ability repertoire as well as weapons.
<br>‚Ä¢	Abilities will have significant impact on the game.

# What will be in the game:

## Main character: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Girl in white suite.
<br>‚Ä¢	Multiple abilities for different play styles.
<br>‚Ä¢	Half mechanic, half humanoid character.

## Enemies: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Futuristic robots in neon digital style.
<br>‚Ä¢	With every level strength of enemies is increasing.
<br>‚Ä¢	Three main enemy types:
<br> >>	Close combat: slasher, smasher ‚Ä¶
<br> >>	Range combat: flamethrower, drones ‚Ä¶
<br> >>	Mid-range/stealth: assassin, heal bot ‚Ä¶

## Allies: 
<br>‚Ä¢	The Vendor is the only ally, one of the ways of getting better weapons and ability upgrades.
<br>‚Ä¢	Will be settled in the generated building. (generated once per level)

## Map: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Each district will change its layout when the player dies. 
<br>‚Ä¢	Map generated in procedural way from created assets.

## Environment: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Futuristic city with tall block buildings in neon style.
<br>‚Ä¢	Trains/lifts transporting through the levels.
<br>‚Ä¢	Multiple levels of environment. (1st ‚Äì closest most detailed enviro (streets and assets directly within the players reach), 2nd ‚Äì further enviro with less details (top parts of the buildings), 3rd ‚Äì far away enviro completing image (background and filler assets))
<br>‚Ä¢	Fog for covering nonvisible areas and creating tension during the game.
