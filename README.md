## Why crimson grounds? 
<br>CRIMSON - a specific color of the blood 
<br>GROUNDS - as for the blood running on the grounds
<br><br>‚Ä¢	Blood will have a significant aspect in the game.

## Game logo: 
<br>Link will be pasted here
<br>Three main points about the game:
<br>‚Ä¢	RAGUUU-LIKE (Rough-like) third view gameplay
<br>‚Ä¢	Beautiful graphics and environment
<br>‚Ä¢	Combo system 

## Gameplay idea:
<br>‚Ä¢	Going though the level, killing enemies, and progressing to the boss.
<br>‚Ä¢	If the player stays in the level stage for two long, number of enemies will increase.
<br>‚Ä¢	Through the gameplay improving ability repertoire as well as weapons.
<br>‚Ä¢	Combos will have significant impact on the game. As the player gets a better grip in the game, the combo styles will improve.

# What will be in the game:

## Menu: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Clean and futuristic style in neutral/cold colors.

## Main character: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Girl in white suite.
<br>‚Ä¢	Three playable styles. (Close, Tank, Range)
<br>‚Ä¢	Multiple weapons and abilities for combo style of play.
<br>‚Ä¢	Half mechanic, half humanoid character.

## Enemies: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Futuristic robots in neon digital style.
<br>‚Ä¢	With every level strength of enemies is increasing.
<br>‚Ä¢	Three main enemy types:
<br> >>	Close combat: slasher, smasher ‚Ä¶
<br> >>	Range combat: flamethrower, drones ‚Ä¶
<br> >>	Mid-range/stealth: assassin, heal robot ‚Ä¶

## Allies: 
<br>‚Ä¢	The Vendor is the only ally, one of the ways of getting better weapons and ability upgrades.
<br>‚Ä¢	Will be settled in the generated building. (Once in a time he shows himself.)

## Map: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Each district will change its shape when the player dies. 
<br>‚Ä¢	Map generated in procedural way from created assets.

## Environment: 
<br>‚Ä¢	Futuristic city with tall block buildings in neon style.
<br>‚Ä¢	Cable cars transporting through the levels.
<br>‚Ä¢	Multiple levels of environment. (1st ‚Äì closest most detailed enviro (streets and assets directly within the players reach), 2nd ‚Äì further enviro with less details (top parts of the buildings), 3rd ‚Äì far away enviro completing image (background and filler assets))
<br>‚Ä¢	Fog for covering nonvisible areas and creating tension during the game.
